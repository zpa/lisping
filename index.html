<a name="what-is-this-about" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this-about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this about?</h3>

<p>I am learning lisp. I decided to share the code I write during the process and to write about the understanding I develop as I proceed. Just like when you learn a new spoken language, you may not get everything right the first time. I know I won't, but that's ok. The play on words in the title should give that away.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>I spent the past several years working in C++, Java, and some other, mostly imperative languages. I grew tired of the inconvenience that you have to put up with sometimes when writing imperative code. I also noticed some recurring patterns of problems that we kept having; however, I was unable to come up with preventive measures.</p>

<p>I then had a small hobby project, the core logic of which I implemented in python. It went very well, and a surprisingly small amount of work helped create some tangible value to a local community. As I was working on the project, I felt thrilled to explore something new, and realized there are so many good things to learn. I felt too much time had passed since I last devoted some time to study something thoroughly.</p>

<p>Influenced by the writings of Paul Graham (such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">this one</a>), I decided to take on not less than learning The Lisp Way. I was intrigued by the clear logical reasoning that pointed out how people trick themselves into avoiding Lisp altogether for various reasons. I was also excited about the promised enlightening, as well as the takeaway that may make you a better hacker altogether. So no excuses this time: hello lisp, here I come.</p>
