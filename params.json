{"name":"Lisping","tagline":"A guided tour along a collection of exercises I set myself to learn lisp.","body":"### What is this about?\r\n\r\nI am learning lisp. I decided to share the code I write during the process and to write about the understanding I develop as I proceed. Just like when you learn a new spoken language, you may not get everything right the first time. I know I won't, but that's ok. The play on words in the title should give that away.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI spent the past several years working in C++, Java, and some other, mostly imperative languages. I grew tired of the inconvenience that you have to put up with sometimes when writing imperative code. I also noticed some recurring patterns of problems that we kept having; however, I was unable to come up with preventive measures.\r\n\r\nI then had a small hobby project, the core logic of which I implemented in python. It went very well, and a surprisingly small amount of work helped create some tangible value to a local community. As I was working on the project, I felt thrilled to explore something new, and realized there are so many good things to learn. I felt too much time had passed since I last devoted some time to study something thoroughly.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the writings of Paul Graham (such as [this one](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)), I decided to take on not less than learning The Lisp Way. I was intrigued by the clear logical reasoning that pointed out how people trick themselves into avoiding Lisp altogether for various reasons. I was also excited about the promised enlightening, as well as the takeaway that may make you a better hacker altogether. So no excuses this time: hello lisp, here I come.\r\n\r\n### Lessons learned\r\n\r\n[Lesson one: Factorial](https://github.com/zpa/lisping/wiki/Lesson-one:-Factorial)\r\n\r\n[Lesson two: Quicksort](https://github.com/zpa/lisping/wiki/Lesson-two:-Quicksort)\r\n\r\n[Lesson three: Eight queens](https://github.com/zpa/lisping/wiki/Lesson-three:-Eight-queens)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
